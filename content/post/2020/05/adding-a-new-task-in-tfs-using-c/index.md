An assignment: using data from the Excel file (sample data below) insert them into TFS (on-premises). Automatically. Start. [You have three months from now](https://youtu.be/XlhihCd6qtw?t=23). Or a few hours.

The original spreadsheet contains 16 records - the header and 15 tasks with 11 columns (skipped here, 8 is enough).

|Work item type|Title |Activity    |Area Path   |Assigned To|Description  |Original Estimate|Completed Work|
|--------------|------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
|Task          |Title1|Requirements|Proj1\\Team1|P Name1    |Description 1|10               |10            |
|Task          |Title2|Maintenance |Proj1\\Team1|P Name2    |Description 2|5                |5             |

Additionally, the tasks should be assigned to the designated User Story: _http://tfsserveraddress/tfs/CollectionName/ProjectName/\_workitems/edit/12345_ and the Sprint _"\\Current\\Sprint 3"_.

In my project, we work with TFS Server 2015. To talk with it using C# I use the [Microsoft.TeamFoundationServer.ExtendedClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TeamFoundationServer.ExtendedClient) package (stable version 16.153.0 at the time of writing). Not everything is possible to use for TFS 2015 (e.g. dashboard editing, as it was introduced for the later TFS API versions), but interacting with the WorkItems works.

For the prototype, I will convert the data from the spreadsheet to the JSON format, and read it as a text in the application. Why JSON? Because I can! Also, because I'm lazy and I will use `JsonConvert.Deserialize()` to prepare the `DataSet`. I like working with `DataSet`s. I will write a separate class with a method that adds all WorkItems from the file

So, to begin with - _File > New > Project / Visual C# / Console App (.Net Framework)_. I use .NET 4.6.1. Then in the Solution Explorer: right-click on the project, select _Add > Class ..._ and create a new file `Workitems.cs`. OK, I have two files in the project (`Program.cs` and `Workitems.cs`), both contain only the template stuff. First - in the `Main()` method, I will set the TFS server address - where I want to insert the data, and the location of the source file.

To connect to the TFS server, I use the `TfsTeamProjectCollectionFactory.GetTeamProjectCollection()` method, where I provide only the `Uri` - address of the server, but with the collection name. The location of the file is a full path. So, the program itself is easy - the `Main()` method looks like below:

```csharp
using Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client;
using System;
(...)
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // TFS Server address, with the collection name
    Uri tfsServerUri = new Uri("http://tfsserveraddress/tfs/CollectionName");

    // connect to TFS
    TfsTeamProjectCollection tfs = TfsTeamProjectCollectionFactory.GetTeamProjectCollection(tfsServerUri);

    //AddWorkItems(tfs);
    string filePath = @"C:\tmp\DataImport.json";

    Workitems mwi = new Workitems();
    mwi.AddFromFile(tfs, filePath);
}
```

I use no authentication methods, as TFS is on-premises and uses domain authentication. When I run the program, my credentials are magically passed to the TFS server during execution of the `GetTeamProjectCollection()` method.

The skeleton of the application is ready. Now, to the

## TFS WorkItem interaction

TFS/Azure DevOps API is built around the REST API concept and uses clients to work with the different aspects of the ecosystem. A different client for the Builds, a different for the Releases, a different one for the WorkItems, and so on. For the WorkItems I will use `WorkItemTrackingHttpClient` (`tfs` is a previously acquired connection to the collection):

```csharp
WorkItemTrackingHttpClient witClient = tfs.GetClient<WorkItemTrackingHttpClient>();
```

To create or update a WorkItem I have to use the `JsonPatchDocument()`, which contains one or more `JsonPatchOperation()` elements. Each of `JsonPatchOperation`s must contain at least three of four elements: `Operation`, `Value`, and `Path`. The fourth - optional - is `From`, but it's used for the move/copy operations.

There's a catch - in [lots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work%20items/create?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1) of the [examples](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-dotnet-samples/blob/master/ClientLibrary/Samples/WorkItemTracking/WorkItemsSample.cs) and tutorials I've seen they show one `JsonPatchDocument` containing one `JsonPatchOperation` - like:

```csharp
JsonPatchDocument patchDocument = new JsonPatchDocument();
patchDocument.Add(
    new JsonPatchOperation()
    {
        Operation = Operation.Add,
        Path = "/fields/System.Title",
        Value = title
    }
);
```

The WorkItem created using code like the above will contain only the title. If I want to add more information about the task, like iteration, who is assigned to the task, the number of hours planned and completed, etc. - I have to add the separate `JsonPatchOperation` for each one of them - like:

```csharp
JsonPatchDocument patchDocument = new JsonPatchDocument();
patchDocument.Add(
    new JsonPatchOperation()
    {
        Operation = Operation.Add,
        Path = "/fields/System.Title",
        Value = "Title1"
    }
);
patchDocument.Add(
    new JsonPatchOperation()
    {
        Operation = Operation.Add,
        Path = "/fields/System.Description",
        Value = "Description 1"
    }
);
```

or in one go:

```csharp
JsonPatchDocument patchDocument = new JsonPatchDocument(
    new JsonPatchOperation()
    {
        Operation = Operation.Add,
        Path = "/fields/System.Title",
        Value = "Title1"
    },
    new JsonPatchOperation()
    {
        Operation = Operation.Add,
        Path = "/fields/System.Description",
        Value = "Description 1"
    }
);
```

Great, I have a pattern I can use. Just one small thing - how can I find the field names? The two above - _System.Description_ and _System.Title_ are taken from the examples, but how can I find the name for CompletedWork? I can use several sources:

1. TFS and Azure DevOps Server (only on-premises version) have an additional **Warehouse** mechanism - a database with dimensions and facts that has the data from all the collections on the server. The `dbo.DimWorkitem` table holds the columns with the names that correspond to the paths. The downside - not all the fields have to be in the warehouse. [![TFS Warehouse dbo.DimWorkItem](images/DimWorkItem.png#center)](images/DimWorkItem.png)
2. In the **collection's database**, there is a table `dbo.tbl_Fields` with all the fields for the collection[![TFS collection database tbl_Field](images/tbl_Field.png#center)](images/tbl_Field.png)
3. I can use Azure DevOps and an **API** link, like _https://azuredevopsserver/Collection/\_apis/wit/fields_ or _https://azuredevopsserver/Collection/Project/\_apis/wit/fields_, take a look at all the entries and use the `referenceName` value; the link does not work in TFS, I had to use Azure DevOps / Azure DevOps Server[![Azure DevOps WorkItem field example](images/AzureDevOpsWorkItemFieldExample.png#center)](http://blog.bartekr.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AzureDevOpsWorkItemFieldExample.png)
4. In the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work%20items/create?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1), there's an example that shows the return value of the created WorkItem, and there's a whole list of field names.

Having the names for the field path I can either modify the Excel file, so the header will contain the proper field names, or I can do some sort of mapping in the code (like _Title_ -> _System.Title_). As it's the prototype, I will use the former and change the file directly. Then I will save it as the CSV file - it's still a prototype, so I will prepare the input data as I see them fit.

The [Data0.csv](https://github.com/BartekR/TFSImport/blob/master/Data0.csv) file contains the source saved as the CSV file. After tweaking (column names as the field names) the source is saved as the [Data1.csv](https://github.com/BartekR/TFSImport/blob/master/Data1.csv). In Poland, CSV files have not a comma, but a semicolon as the separator. I use PowerShell to convert it to JSON:

```powershell
Import-Csv -Path C:\\tmp\\Data1.csv -Delimiter ";" | ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content C:\\tmp\\Data1.json
```

The output looks like below (notice double backslash instead of one, as in the source):

```json
[
    {
        "System.Title":  "Title1",
        "System.Activity":  "Requirements",
        "System.AreaPath":  "Proj1\\Team1",
        "System.AssignedTo":  "P Name1",
        "System.Description":  "Description 1",
        "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.OriginalEstimate":  "10",
        "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.CompletedWork":  "10",
        "IterationPath":  "\\Current\\Sprint 3"
    },
    {
        "System.Title":  "Title2",
        "System.Activity":  "Maintenance",
        "System.AreaPath":  "Projt1\\Team1",
        "System.AssignedTo":  "P Name2",
        "System.Description":  "Description 2",
        "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.OriginalEstimate":  "5",
        "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.CompletedWork":  "5",
        "IterationPath":  "\\Current\\Sprint 3"
    }
]
```

The input is ready, now to

## The WorkItems creation

I will write a method in the Workitems class:

```csharp
public void AddFromFile(TfsTeamProjectCollection tfs, string filePath)
```

It will use theÂ  `WorkItemTrackingHttpClient` mentioned above. I will also set some parameters as the variables

```csharp
WorkItemTrackingHttpClient witClient = tfs.GetClient<WorkItemTrackingHttpClient>();
string witType = "Task";
string projectName = "Project1";
```

I also wrote I will use `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject()` to convert JSON data to the `DataSet`, so I read the [Data1.json](https://github.com/BartekR/TFSImport/blob/master/Data1.json). Also - I [have to give a name to the dataset](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/DeserializeDataSet.htm), so I concatenate it with 'Tasks' and prepare one JSON element with an array of the entries:

```csharp
string jsonTasksSrc = File.ReadAllText(filePath);
string jsonTasks = "{'Tasks' : " + jsonTasksSrc + "}";

DataSet x = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonTasks);
```

I have the `DataSet`, so I can read the `DataTable`, iterate over it, and prepare `JsonPathOperation`s with the fields - each `DataTable` column contains names and values.

```csharp
foreach (DataRow r in x.Tables["Tasks"].Rows)
{
    JsonPatchDocument wit = new JsonPatchDocument();

    foreach (DataColumn c in r.Table.Columns)
    {
        string sPath = "/fields/" + c.ColumnName;
        string sValue = r[c.ColumnName].ToString();

        wit.Add(new JsonPatchOperation()
        {
            Path = sPath,
            Operation = Operation.Add,
            Value = sValue
        });
    }
}
```

The last thing - adding the parent User Story. I found the [answer by Marina](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50518798/how-to-add-work-item-as-child-to-parent) on StackOverflow - use `/relations/-` as the path with the relation defined as `Hierarchy-Reverse`:

```csharp
string relation = @"{
    'rel' : 'System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Reverse',
    'url' : 'http://tfsserveraddress/tfs/CollectionName/ProjectName/_workitems/edit/12345'
}";
```

In this case - as it's a JSON construct - the `Value` of the `JsonPathOperation` should be a `JToken` instead of just a `string`, so I have to cast it:

```csharp
wit.Add(new JsonPatchOperation()
{
    Path = "/relations/-",
    Operation = Operation.Add,
    Value = JToken.Parse(relation)
});
```

Now I can create the WorkItem:

```csharp
WorkItem w = witClient.CreateWorkItemAsync(wit, projectName, witType).Result;
```

The last thing - the WorkItem is created as _New_. I have to set it as closed because I report the finished tasks:

```csharp
_ = witClient.UpdateWorkItemAsync(p, w.Id.Value).Result;
```

The underscore means that I'm not interested in the result (during the debugging process I checked that it works) so I discard it.

And that's it! It looks like it's working.

The next steps - checking how it works with Azure DevOps in Azure and a bit more of parametrisation. Also, I have to verify if I have to pass a full URL for the parent WorkItem (User Story) and if it's possible to insert the task with the _Closed_ status (not possible form the GUI - the only option is New). But that's a subject for a different blog post.

The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/BartekR/TFSImport).
