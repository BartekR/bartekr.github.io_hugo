I wanted to return to bloging after a break, and I wanted to make something different. I thought: why not write it with an RPG map, and minimum story arc for learning new things? And I gave it a try, using containers as main theme. I wanted to refresh and deepen my knowledge about them, and then extend it to a broader scope. As Azure is my main cloud of choice, I also planned to learn a lot about containers ecosystem there. And - as I'm dealing with infrastructure as code - I decided to use Terraform (my daily tool), and learn Bicep (not a daily tool at all).

The adventure started with an idea, a map, few characters along the way, starting point (WSL2), and minimal plan. And here's what has happened (so far):
